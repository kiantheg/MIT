## Getting Emulator ready:
* If you don't already have the emulator repo, download it here --> [emulator](https://github.com/bwsiuassar/emulator.gite)
* Recommended emulator settings:
    * Logger state = `STATUS`
* Look at the emulator readme for running emulator commands --> [emulator commands] (https://github.com/bwsiuassar/emulator#511-arguments)
   > Our code runs with all op_modes (develop, test, real) 
* Open up a terminal window to run the emulator

## Running Our Program
* Open up another new terminal window while the emulator is running. This terminal window is where you will run our code.
* Run `client.py` and follow the prompted messages to execute the progra,

## Configurations
* We currently have set configurations in `configurations.py`. Feel free to change certain paramaters such as `scan_count` and `range_resolution` here.
