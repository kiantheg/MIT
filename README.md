## How to Run Our Code:
* Open up two terminal prompts, one will be for running the emulator server and the other will be running for this repository's program.
* If you don't already have the emulator repo, download it here --> [emulator](https://github.com/bwsiuassar/emulator.gite)
* Recommended emulator settings:
    * Logger state = `STATUS`
* Look at the emulator readme for running emulator commands --> [emulator commands] (https://github.com/bwsiuassar/emulator#511-arguments)
   > Our code runs with all op_modes (develop, test, real)
