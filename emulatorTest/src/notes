- what we have
    • send and receiving messages to and from emulator
    • gather scan data and position data
    • able to process data and get constants like bandwith, frequency, wavelength, etc.
    • able to plot black and white image using pre-entered values for Range and Cross Range Resolutions
- first
    • figure out how to process image and make things work from scan data
    • more specifically figure out back-projection 
    • basically, make the thing
- second
    • make it effiecient maybe through vectorization
